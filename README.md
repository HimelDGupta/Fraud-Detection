# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card data using machine learning models. We explore various preprocessing techniques, handle imbalanced datasets, train different models, and evaluate their performance through metrics and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards, where each transaction is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. Due to confidentiality, the features are transformed using PCA, except for the 'Amount' and 'Class' (the label).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
